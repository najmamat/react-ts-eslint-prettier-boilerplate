# Getting Started with Create React+TS App
This project works as a tempate starter project with all dependecies set up and working. Project is set up with basic eslint and prettier. Correction working with CDM+S

You have to run `npm install` after using this template project to install all dependencies
## Or follow these steps (creating react+ts app from scratch)
- use `npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript`
- copy contents from this project into yours package.json
- run `npm install`
- copy file `.eslintrd.js` and add it to the root
- copy file `.prettierrc.js` and add it to the root
- create folder in root named `.vscode`
- inside folder `.vscode` create file `settings.json` and paste its contents
- make sure you have ESLINT and PRETTIER extensions installed in your VSCODE

You can check if eslint and prettier is working -> make a mistake and run `npm run lint:fix`

Or make a mistake and eslint+prettier should format your code after you save your file with CMD+S
